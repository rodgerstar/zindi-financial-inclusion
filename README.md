# Zindi Financial Inclusion Project

This is my machine learning project for the **Financial Inclusion in Africa** competition on Zindi.

Goal: Predict whether a person has a bank account (Yes/No) using demographic and survey data from Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda.

## Current Best Model
- XGBoost with tuning (min_child_weight=1, gamma=1, subsample=0.8, max_depth=5)
- Local validation error: ~0.1088
- Public leaderboard MAE: 0.1136 (first submission)

## Project Files
- StarterNotebook.ipynb → main notebook with all code, experiments, and submissions
- Train.csv / Test.csv / SampleSubmission.csv → original data
- submission_v*.csv → my prediction files

## How to run
1. Open StarterNotebook.ipynb in Google Colab
2. Mount Google Drive (if data is in Drive)
3. Run all cells step by step

## My GitHub journey
first commit with V6 model.
